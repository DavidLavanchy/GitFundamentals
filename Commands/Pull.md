# git pull
Similar to a [git push](./push.md), a `git pull` will interact with a remote repository. Only this time it will **pull** the changes it does not have from a remote down to the local repository. This means that any commits that are on the [remote](./Remote.md) repository will be pulled down and added to the local repositoy. 

This can be done by adding the remote name and branch:

```git pull origin main ```

If there is any upstream connection established, you can use ` git pull` without specifying a remote of branch.
