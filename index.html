    <p>Indiana, or the crossroads of Indiana, is a hidden jewel of the midwest. Indiana is not only host to the best tenderloin sandwich in the continental United States, but also is home to the world famnous Indianapolis 500 mile race. 
        With prosperous metropolitan areas such as Indianapolis, Evansville, and Fort Wayne, you can find a plethora of entertainment that will fit your needs. On the contrary, if you'd like to get out of the hussle and bussle then visit one of Indiana's rural getaways in Nashville, Monticello, or French Lick.
        There is something for the whole family to enjoy.
